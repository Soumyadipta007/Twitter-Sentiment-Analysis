# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
The objective of this task is to detect Negative Sentiment and Positive Sentiment tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains Negative Sentiment if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.
